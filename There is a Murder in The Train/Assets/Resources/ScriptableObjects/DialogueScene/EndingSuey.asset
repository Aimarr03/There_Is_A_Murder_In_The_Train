  entries:
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Everyone, I need you to stay calm when I say this. For it might be against
      what you've known so far.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - I believe the victim, Mr. Landersan, did not fall victim to foul play. But
      rather took his own life.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - Hold your tongue! You're saying Thomas commited suicide?
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - That is unthinkable. Thomas would never...
  - speakerName: Lucas Blackwood
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - Suicide? That's a tough claim, milady.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - 'Please, let me explain. This wasn''t a simple suicide. '
    - It was a meticulously orchestrated act, crafted to cast suspicion on Cedric.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Wait a minute. You're suggesting he staged his own suicide? To frame dear old
      me?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - Exactly. The details we've overlooked are the key. The empty sauce bottle,
      seemingly insignificant, was a calculated distraction.
    - But the real clue was the dropped spoon during their meal.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - "He did drop his spoon, though I don\u2019t see how that would mean anything."
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Normal
    speakerLines:
    - Indeed. That spoon, intentionally swapped with the one he had hidden, was the
      linchpin.
  - speakerName: Lucas Blackwood
    speakerExpression: Normal
    speakerLines:
    - So, it was part of a ruse?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - Absolutely. This spoon swap provided Cedric with the perfect opportunity to
      introduce the poison.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - But why go to such lengths? What would drive him to orchestrate his own death?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Normal
    speakerLines:
    - The answer lies in the weight of his circumstances, particularly his entanglement
      with Cedric.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - My involvement with him led to this?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Normal
    speakerLines:
    - Financial records and business dealings unveil a crumbling partnership that
      took a severe toll on Thomas's mental health.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - So, his failing health was a consequence of this business turmoil?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Normal
    speakerLines:
    - Precisely. The stress, anxiety, and the bleak future of Landertech Industries
      took an unbearable toll.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - But why go to such lengths to frame me?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - 'Because Thomas''s ultimate aim was to dissolve the partnership between the
      Whitestone and Landersan families. '
    - This intricate scheme served as his means to achieve that end.
  - speakerName: Lucas Blackwood
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - He truly was a deeply troubled soul, burdened by his perception of the world.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - I can't wrap my head around this... It's almost too much.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - This changes everything. I never saw this coming.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Mysteries often lie beneath layers we thought not to explore.
  - speakerName: Officer 01
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - This raises important questions. Are there more details you can provide, Miss?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Normal
    speakerLines:
    - Certainly. The evidence not only points to Thomas's intention but also to the
      meticulous planning he undertook.
    - His medical records indicate a dire decline in his health, matched by the instability
      of his company's financial health.
  - speakerName: Lucas Blackwood
    speakerExpression: Normal
    speakerLines:
    - So, his actions were indeed driven by desperation.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - "Exactly. He wanted to secure a future for Landertech Industries without the
      shadow of the Whitestones\u2019 influence."
    - Or rather, he would like for it all to end if it means not having the Whitestones
      take complete control.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - But how does the poison fit into all of this?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Normal
    speakerLines:
    - 'The poison was a tool to ensure Cedric''s involvement in the scenario. '
    - By creating suspicion, Thomas intended to push Cedric to face the consequences
      of their crumbling partnership.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - So, he wanted my family's legacy to crumble.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Yes, but this act wasn't just about that. It was about freeing himself from
      the chains that bound him.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Is that so? Well, this doesn't feel freeing to me.
    - I feel as if I will be chained by the guilt of this event to the end of my
      days.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
