  entries:
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - 'Um... I know this might sound a bit outlandish, but... I have this theory. '
    - What if... what if the robot chef is somehow involved in the crime?
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - Hold your thought for a moment. You're saying a machine committed murder?
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - Oh, this is a new level of mystery-solving, isn't it?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - I understand how it sounds, but please, hear what I have to say.
    - "The sauce bottle \u2013 it's used for seasoning, including Cedric's Vichyssoise.
      Yet, we found the same empty bottle in the kitchen's disposal bin."
  - speakerName: Officer 01
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Are you suggesting the robot went rogue?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - No, not the robot itself. But someone could have manipulated its actions for
      a purpose.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - So, someone's using a robot to commit murder now?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - It's not that simple. The robot is innocent, a mere tool in all of this.
  - speakerName: Lucas Blackwood
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - But that's impossible. The robot follows strict programming.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - Exactly, it's about diverting our attention. The true culprit used the robot's
      routine
  - speakerName: Officer 01
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - You think someone used the robot to their advantage?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - Yes, and I suspect... the waiter.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - The waiter? Truly?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - I believe so. He had access to the kitchen, the means to switch the bottles.
  - speakerName: Lucas Blackwood
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - This is absurd! I've served him for years, and I would never...
  - speakerName: Officer 01
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Let's not jump to conclusions here.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - "No, I'm sure. There's a motive \u2013 perhaps a grudge that was hidden."
    - The resentment that's been festering ever since he served the victim as his
      butler.
  - speakerName: Lucas Blackwood
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - I treated him well! Why would I...?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Sometimes it's not about how you treat someone, but how you feel you were treated.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - Are you being serious right now?
  - speakerName: Officer 01
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - I admit I am perplexed, though we do need to consider all angles.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - It does seem a bit farfetched and sudden. But it seems our detective has a
      knack for rather surprising conclusions.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Well, I'm not buying into this robot theory.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Oh well. At least you should be thankful the young lady here cleared your name.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - Thankful? For being falsely accused in the first place?
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - What a coincidence that you often find yourself in these situations, Mr. Whitestone.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - Coincidence? That is a blatant insult! I demand an apology.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - Oh, come on. It's all in good fun.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Well, not like anyone even cares anyway.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Um, I'm sorry if this conclusion isn't at all what you expected.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - No worries. I just need some time alone to enjoy the scenery.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - I didn't exactly mean to offend anyone.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - I didn't exactly mean to offend anyone.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - Save it. You're way over your head.
