    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - Cedric Whitestone, you are under suspicion for the murder of Thomas Landersan.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - Me? Accused of murder? This is madness!
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - Well, well, looks like our detective finally cracked the case.
    - And she's not too shabby at all. Took you long enough to realize he was the
      killer. It was obvious from the start after all.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - Enough of this nonsense! I won't stand here and be accused unjustly.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Normal
    speakerLines:
    - Oh, come on, Cedric. You're not going to argue with our detective's expertise,
      are you?
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - There is zero thought put into that accusation! Why would I kill my friend?
      Our partnership was mutually beneficial!
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Mr. Whitestone, there's more to it than meets the eye. I've found a motive
      behind this.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - Do tell, Ms. detective. I'm all ears.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - Your business practices, Mr. Whitestone, were ruthless. You manipulated the
      partnership between your family and the Landersans.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - So, Cedric, you were profiting at the expense of the Landersans?
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - This is absurd! I said our partnership was always mutually beneficial.
    - Such a statement is baseless beyond measure!
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - But then, things changed. Thomas saw through your tactics. He realized you
      were exploiting his company and manipulating market prices.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - Senseless drivel! As I've said you have no evidence to support these claims.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - The poison, the same poison used in your favorite Vichyssoise, a dish you ordered.
      The poison that took Thomas's life.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - It looks like you're in quite the predicament.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - I won't accept this. I won't accept any of this! I'm innocent!
  - speakerName: Lucas Blackwood
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Master Whitestone, is what she said the truth?
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - No, of course not! This is absurd!
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - Oh, for the love of--Please just stop deflecting and answer the question. It'll
      be easier for everyone involved.
  - speakerName: Officer 01
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - Let's maintain order here. If our detective has evidence, then let's hear it.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Normal
    speakerLines:
    - Thank you, officer. The evidence points to Mr. Whitestone's involvement in
      the poisoning.
  - speakerName: Lucas Blackwood
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - And what of the poison?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - The poison was traced back to a confidential recipe, one that had been tampered
      with by a scientist you had fired, Mr. Whitestone. This poison was designed
      exclusively to target Thomas.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - This is an unfathomable fabrication! You all should be ashamed!
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - "Oh sweet Sir Cedric, you\u2019ve hit the ground and even started to dig!"
  - speakerName: Officer 01
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Let's all remain calm here. We'll need to investigate further.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - "Well well, Amelia, you\u2019ve certainly made quite the revelation."
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - I didn't expect it to unfold like this.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - I didn't expect it to unfold like this.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - Ah, the mystery-solving prodigy strikes true, I pray your future of solving
      crimes will be ever so bright!
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - Well, it's more about finding out the truth. Haha.
