    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - Hm... You don't quite resemble the security personnel.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - I... I suppose I don't quite fit the bill, huh? Haha...
    - Um, pardon me, but I'd like to inquire about the events involving the victim.
      I was present when he was found, though I lack the full picture.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - And why should I entertain a stranger who isn't part of the security team?
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Oh... I apologize if I came across as impolite. My name is Amelia Rivers. I'm
      a criminology student who happened to be present during the incident.

    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - '"Happened to be present", you say?'

    - Y-yes...
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - Well, I suppose no harm can be done in indulging you, I suppose.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - However, let it be known that I vehemently deny any involvement in this crime.
      I swear it upon the name of my family, the Whitestones.

    speakerLines:
    - Umm... Alright, Mr. Whitestone. Can you please describe your actions during
      the events?

    speakerLines:
    - I was seated across from my friend. We were having lunch, a delightful Vichyssoise.
      He mentioned feeling unwell and headed to the bathroom before finishing his
      meal.
    - I offered to accompany him, concerned for his health, but he declined. So,
      I stayed at my seat, awaiting his return.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - "When he did, he resumed eating but suddenly choked and panicked, creating
      a chaotic scene. He coughed, struggled, and then went still\u2014unconscious."
    - I was baffled, and then security arrived. You know the rest.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - I'm sorry, I seem to have rambled off track.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - Oh... no, it's alright. Your account is quite informative, and I... um... appreciate
      your willingness to share.
    - Ahem, moving on, you mentioned he's your friend, correct? Could you tell me
      more about him and your relationship?
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - "Indeed, his name is Thomas Landersan. He's a dear friend. Our families have
      a longstanding business partnership\u2014our Whitestone and Landersan."
    - They handle production, and we handle marketing. Thomas was the head of his
      company, while I'm slated to lead the Whitestone family.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - Thomas Landersan... Isn't he the head of Landertech Industries?
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - You're absolutely right, Ms. Rivers. Impressive research.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - Um... yes, well, you know... I try to stay informed... Ehehe.

    - No, that covers it for now. Thank you for your time and cooperation.

      realize that.
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - I'll keep that in mind.
