    - Hmm... What is it?
  - speakerName: Amelia
    speakerExpression: Normal
    speakerLines:
    - Ahem, I wanted to talk to you. Umm... I'm Amelia Rivers, a criminology student.
  - speakerName: Chloe
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - Ooh.. A criminology student who just happened to find herself in the heart
      of a crime scene?
    - How intriguing. Well, well, Ms. Criminology, what brings you here? To pry into
      my life, I presume?
  - speakerName: Amelia
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - "Yes, um\u2026 I'd like to delve into your background."
    - Specifically, your whereabouts during the incident and any ties you might have
      had with the victim.
  - speakerName: Chloe
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - Considering the circumstances, I suppose it's only natural that I'd be subjected
      to questioning.
  - speakerName: Chloe
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Oh, the misfortune of gaining notoriety in such a fashion.
  - speakerName: Chloe
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - As you've probably gathered, I go by Chloe Rutherford.
  - speakerName: Chloe
    speakerExpression: Normal
    speakerLines:
    - But for our conversation, let's settle on Ms. Rutherford, shall we?
  - speakerName: Amelia
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - '(Doesn''t she look younger than me? Her appearance belies her demeanor, though
      appearances can be deceiving)

'
  - speakerName: Amelia
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - And... Where exactly were you when the incident occurred, Ms. Rutherford?
  - speakerName: Chloe
    speakerExpression: Normal
    speakerLines:
    - Isn't that obvious? I was right there in the same room with the victim and
      the alleged murderer.
  - speakerName: Amelia
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Could you specify your exact location, please? And what occupied your attention?
  - speakerName: Chloe
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - A bit cheeky, aren't you?
  - speakerName: Chloe
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - 'Very well, let''s play along. I had the privilege of being seated near the
      victim''s table. '
    - a mere observer partaking in my meal and the picturesque scenery through the
      window.
  - speakerName: Chloe
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - 'Very well, let''s play along. I had the privilege of being seated near the

    - a mere observer partaking in my meal and the picturesque scenery through the
      window.
  - speakerName: Chloe
    speakerExpression: Normal
    speakerLines:
    - Will that satisfy your thirst for details, Madam Criminology?
  - speakerName: Amelia
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - Why such haste in labeling the victim's companion as the assailant?
  - speakerName: Chloe
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - Why are you so surprised? You're the criminology expert here, right? It's a
      classic trope.
    - The one closest to the victim often ends up being the prime suspect, the person
      right across from him at the table.
  - speakerName: Amelia
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - But has it been established beyond a shadow of a doubt that the companion is
      responsible for the victim's demise?
    - Could it not have been a result of a pre-existing condition?
  - speakerName: Chloe
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - 'That''s outrageous, my dear. The victim was visibly distressed during the
      event. '
    - I myself was absolutely taken aback...
  - speakerName: Amelia
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Understood... Uh... Lastly, do you have any sort of connection with the victim?
  - speakerName: Chloe
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - I can assure you, I had no connection with him whatsoever.
  - speakerName: Chloe
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - Now, is this interrogation complete, or should I expect more inquisitions?
  - speakerName: Amelia
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - Yes... Th-thank you, Ms. Rutherford, for your time and cooperation.
  - speakerName: Chloe
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - 'Indeed. And do adjust that tone, Ms. Criminology Student. '
    - We wouldn't want to waste anyone's time with unnecessary stuttering.
  - speakerName: Amelia
    speakerExpression: Sad
    speakerLines:
    - I'll take that into consideration.
    - (That was exasperating, the way she brought herself was almost suffocating.)
