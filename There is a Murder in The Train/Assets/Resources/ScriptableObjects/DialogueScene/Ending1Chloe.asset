    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - "Is that so? And what's your point, Miss \u201CDetective\u201D?"
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers

    speakerExpression: Sad

    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - Oh, my dear Amelia, I'm flattered by your imagination.

    speakerLines:
    - Though this does not mean you are correct by any means.
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - Chloe, just admit it. Your obsession led you to poison him, to ensure he'd
      be yours and yours alone.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - What? You think I'd resort to something like that? How absurd!
  - speakerName: Amelia Rivers
    speakerExpression: Shout

    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - And where might YOUR evidence be?
  - speakerName: Cedric Whitestone
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - The pieces fit. Your obsession, his journal, the unique connection you both
      had.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - You're both insufferable. You know nothing about my feelings.
  - speakerName: Officer 01
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - Enough. Miss Chloe Rutherford, you will be taken into custody. You have the
      right to remain silent.
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Shout
    speakerLines:
    - "You think you've won, haven\u2019t you? You're nothing but a blind, incompetent
      wannabe detective!"
    - You know nothing beyond your naive arrogance and delusions of your shallow
      amateurish knowledge of your field!
    - "Oh, and Ms. \u201CCriminology Student\u201D, do us all a favor and stick to
      solving puzzles, not real crimes! "
    - You're clearly out of your depth!
  - speakerName: Chloe Rutherford
    speakerExpression: Angry
