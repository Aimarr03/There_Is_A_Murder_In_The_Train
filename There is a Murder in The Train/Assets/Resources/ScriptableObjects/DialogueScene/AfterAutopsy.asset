      using.

    - 'However, it seems that one of the passengers is a criminology student who
      is willing to help unravel the truth.

'
    - I know how unprofessional that might seem, but in a case as unusual as this,
      we need all the help we can get.

    - Huh?
  - speakerName: Officer
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - "That aside, the victim\u2019s companion who happened to sit in front of him
      before and after the events remains the main suspect. "
    - With that in mind, please comply with us, we will monitor your actions from
      here on.
  - speakerName: Cedric
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:

    - Miss Rivers, as promised we will give you detailed information regarding the
      victim's body.
  - speakerName: Amelia
    speakerExpression: Normal
    speakerLines:
    - Okay, please do share what you have found, officer.
  - speakerName: Officer
    speakerExpression: Happy
    speakerLines:
    - Right, setting aside the information we have provided towards the public, we
      would like to discuss with you regarding whatever surrounds this case.
  - speakerName: Officer
    speakerExpression: Angry
    speakerLines:
    - Ahem.. On the scene, we have found more utensils than there should be.
    - As you know, the train policy is not to provide large amounts of utensils on
      the table at once, but to serve it along with the food so there will be no
      unnecessary extras on the table.
    - "Regarding those utensils, one is contaminated with poison and one does not.
      We could assume that the victim\u2019s companion had a chance to swap them
      in the victim\u2019s absence."

      We could assume that the victim\u2019s companion had a chance to swap them
      in the victim\u2019s absence."
    - "The victim himself isn\u2019t covered in any bruises so a fight most certainly
      didn\u2019t occur before the fact. Most likely that the victim made a scene
      after the poison took effect."

    - 'That is all regarding the autopsy. All this leads to the main suspect. Is
      there anything you would like to know more about?

    - "No.. that will be enough, let me gather more information first, then I\u2019ll
      gather the people to unravel the truth."

    - As you wish, best of luck, Miss Rivers!
